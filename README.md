# 📊 Data Cleaning for Sales Calling List

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a customer sales calling list for analysis and outreach. The dataset contains customer details such as phone numbers, addresses, and contact preferences. To ensure data accuracy and usability, various cleaning steps are applied using Python and Pandas.


## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Exploration

- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

- Inspect the structure and check column names

- Identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

### 2️⃣ Standardization

- Convert column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores

- Normalize categorical values (e.g., replacing "Y/N" with "Yes/No")

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Remove duplicates and unnecessary columns

- Handle missing values appropriately (fill or drop)

- Strip special characters from text fields (e.g., last names, phone numbers)

### 4️⃣ Data Transformation

- Format phone numbers into a standard format (XXX-XXX-XXXX)

- Split address fields into separate columns (Street, State, Zip Code)

### 5️⃣ Filtering & Final Touches

- Keep only customers who have valid phone numbers and allow contact

- Ensure the cleaned dataset is ready for use
